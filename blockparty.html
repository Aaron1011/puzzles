<h1>Block Party</h1>

<p>Another little known use of Python programming is solving real-world block
puzzles.</p>

<p>Take for example the notoriously difficult 
<a href="http://www.pavelspuzzles.com/2010/08/the_calibron_12block_puzzle.html">12-Block Calibron puzzle</a>. 
It was invented by the son of Thomas Edison. Or at least, he got the credit for
it. (Like father, like son.)</p>

<p>It seems simple. You've got 12 rectangular tiles with these dimensions: </p>

<blockquote>
32&times;11 &nbsp;&nbsp;
32&times;10 &nbsp;&nbsp;
28&times;14 &nbsp;&nbsp;
28&times;7 &nbsp;&nbsp;
28&times;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;
21&times;18 &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>
21&times;18 &nbsp;&nbsp;
21&times;14 &nbsp;&nbsp;
21&times;14 &nbsp;&nbsp;
17&times;14 &nbsp;&nbsp;
14&times;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;
10&times;7 &nbsp;&nbsp;
</blockquote>

<p>or, as a Python-ready list:</p>

<pre>
tiles = [
    (32, 11),
    (32, 10),
    (28, 14),
    (28, 7),
    (28, 6),
    (21, 18),
    (21, 18),
    (21, 14),
    (21, 14),
    (17, 14),
    (14, 4),
    (10, 7),
]
</pre>

<p>(Yes, there are duplicates in the list, you have pairs of blocks of the same
size.) All you have to do (ha!) is arrange them so they form a single rectangle
with no gaps.</p>

<p>The problem is that the search space is very big. So this cries out for a
computational approach.</p>

<p>1. What is the total surface area of the final solution?</p>

<p>2. OK that was easy. But how about the height and width of all possible (or
let's call them, potential) rectangle solutions? Write a program that generates
that list.</p>

<p>3. Finally, the really hard part. Write a program that searches for a
solution to the 12-Block Calibron puzzle. (Apparently there is only one.)</p>

<p>4. Bonus: How unique is the 12-Block Calibron within puzzle space? What
makes an n-block Calibron a good puzzle, that has one and only one solution?
Write a program that generates n-block Calibron puzzles.</p>
